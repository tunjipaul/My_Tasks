# key rules.
# 1. init always takes self as first parameter.
# 2. all methods take self as first parameter.
# 3. never pass self manually when calling methods.
# 4. use self inside methods  to access object's attributes.
# 5. self refers to the specific object being used.

# attributes are the characteristics, properties that describe an object, answering the question, what does this object look like, or what information does this object store.

# real-world analogy
# think of a nigerian national ID Card.

# me:  adebayo tosin
# age : 28
# state of origin : lagos
# lga: "ikeja"
# occupation: software developer, these only describe the person not what the person can do.

# encapsulation is like putting related items in a box and controlling who can access them. it groups related

# what you can access: keyad, screen, card slot, cash dispenser.
# what you cannot access: internal cash storage, computer motherboard, security cameras.
# atm encapsulates all its internal components and gives you safe ways to interact with it.
