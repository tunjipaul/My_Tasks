    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    " - Meet Adamu\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Adamu is a 45-year-old tomato farmer from Kano State who cultivates 3 hectares of farmland. Every harvest season tells the same heartbreaking story. Monday morning at 6:00 AM, Adamu wakes up to check his tomato crop - 500 crates ready for harvest after months of hard work, investment in seeds, fertilizers, and sleepless nights protecting his farm. Tuesday at 8:00 AM, he contacts Mallam Sani, the local middleman who has been buying from farmers for 15 years. Sani offers ₦800 per crate. Adamu has no idea that tomatoes are selling for ₦2,200 per crate in Lagos markets and ₦1,800 in Abuja. Wednesday, Adamu reluctantly accepts Sani's offer of ₦400,000 for his entire harvest, not knowing that restaurants in nearby Kaduna are desperately seeking fresh tomatoes and willing to pay ₦1,500 per crate - almost double Sani's price. Thursday, Sani transports the tomatoes to Lagos and sells them for ₦1,100,000, making ₦700,000 profit while Adamu struggles to recover his farming costs of ₦350,000, leaving him with just ₦50,000 profit for months of labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Meet Kemi\n",
    "\n",
    "Kemi owns three restaurants in Abuja and faces her own challenges. Every morning, she drives 45 minutes to Mile 12 market, fighting traffic and paying high transportation costs to buy vegetables at inflated prices from multiple middlemen. She never knows daily prices until she arrives at the market, making it impossible to plan her restaurant menus and pricing effectively. By the time produce reaches her through 3-4 middlemen, vegetables are often wilted, reducing her restaurant's food quality. During rainy seasons or transport strikes, she sometimes can't get vegetables at all, forcing her to close her restaurants or serve limited menus. Kemi often thinks: \"If only I could buy directly from farmers like Adamu, we would both benefit - I'd get fresher produce at better prices, and farmers would earn more for their hard work.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This story repeats across Nigeria's 70 million smallholder farmers\n",
    "\n",
    "- 40% of harvest is lost to post-harvest waste due to poor market connections\n",
    "- Middlemen capture 60-70% of final selling prices\n",
    "- Farmers remain trapped in poverty despite feeding the nation\n",
    "- Buyers pay premium prices for lower quality produce\n",
    "- The economy loses billions in agricultural value due to inefficient markets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nigerian agricultural commerce is trapped in a cycle of inefficiency that impoverishes farmers and inflates costs for consumers. The core challenges include:\n",
    "1. Information Asymmetry Crisis\n",
    "\n",
    "Farmers lack real-time market price information across different locations\n",
    "No visibility into demand patterns or seasonal price trends\n",
    "Limited knowledge of alternative buyers and market opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Middleman Exploitation System\n",
    "\n",
    "Farmers forced to accept below-market prices due to lack of alternatives\n",
    "Multiple layers of middlemen inflate final prices by 200-400%\n",
    "No direct connection channels between farmers and end buyers\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Market Access Barriers\n",
    "\n",
    "Rural farmers cannot reach urban markets due to transportation costs\n",
    "No platform for farmers to advertise their products and prices\n",
    "Buyers cannot locate specific farmers or products in their regions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Technology Gap\n",
    "\n",
    "Most agricultural solutions require smartphones and internet access\n",
    "85% of rural farmers only have basic mobile phones with USSD capability\n",
    "Existing platforms are too complex for farmers with limited digital literacy\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Economic Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Farmers earn 20-30% of final retail prices for their products\n",
    "Post-harvest losses reach 40% due to poor market connections\n",
    "Agricultural productivity growth stagnates despite increasing food demand\n",
