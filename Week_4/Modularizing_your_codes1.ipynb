    "- Modular programming is a way of writing programs by dividing them into smaller, independent, and reusable parts (modules) instead of writing one long block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A module can be a function, a class, or a Python file (.py) that performs a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These modules can then be combined to build a complete program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In simple words, modular programming `=` breaking big problems into smaller, manageable solutions."

    " \n",
    " - *1. Readability*\n",
    "  - Breaking code into smaller modules makes it easier to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Instead of scrolling through hundreds of lines inside a file, you can just put them in different files within a folder and look at the specific file that has the codes you need.\n",
    " \n",
    " - *2. Reusability*\n",
    "  - Once you create a module, you can reuse it in different programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - No need to rewrite the same code over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - For example, A function that calculates the area of a circle can be used in a school project, an engineering project, or even in a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *3. Debugging and Maintenance*\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If there’s an error, you only need to check the specific module where the problem is, instead of combing through the whole program.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Updating or improving one module doesn’t break the rest of the system.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - LEts say, you are building a banking application. If the `payment module` in the app has a bug, the `user login module` is unaffected.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - *4. Teamwork and Collaboration*\n",
    "\n",
    "     - In real-world projects, different developers can work on different modules simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Later, all modules are combined into the main project.\n",

    "     - For example,In building a school management system.\n",
