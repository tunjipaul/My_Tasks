# #handling errors in python.
# #there are 3 categories of errors in python.
# #  -syntax error
# # it occurs when python interpreter cannot understand your code because you broke python grammar rules., it won't work until you code is fixed.
# # types of syntax errors.
# # indentation error - incorrect spacing.
# #indentaion is paragraphing.
# # for i in range(3):
# # print(i)

# # #missing colon/parenthesis error.
# # if 5>3 #missing colon
# #  print("hello")
# # #invalid syntax - general grammar mistakes.
# # print "hello"  #missing parentheses.
# #runtime errors. 
# #the program is syntactically correct, but an error occurs while it is running.
# #runtime errors are also called excepetions.
# #they can be handled with try, except, and finally.
# #common subtypes of runtime errors.
# #- zerodivison error. - dividing by zero
# # print (10/0)
# # #nameerror - using a variable before defining it.
# # print(age)  #age not defined.
# # # TypeError - wrong data type in an operation.
# # result = "10" + 5 #str + int not allowed
# # #valueerror - invalid value for a function.
# # # number = int("abc") #cannot convert str to int.
# # # index error - accessing list index out of range.
# # fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
# # print(fruits[3]) #index out of range, meaning that the length of the variable, fruits is 2.
# # #keyerror - accesing a dictionary with a missing key.
# # data = {"name": "ada"}
# # print(data["age"]) #key not found. meaning that the key "age" is not available.
# # #filenotfounderror - file does not exist.
# # f = open("missing.txt") #file not found.

# #handling runtime errors
# #python provides exception handling to prevent programs from crashing when unexpected errors occur.
# #keywords used are : try, except and finally.
#  #the try block is used to wrap code that might raise an error.
# #  #if no error occurs, python skips the excpet block.
# # try: 
# #     x= 10/0
# #     print("Result:",  x)

# # #the except block.
# # it defines what to do if an error occurs inside try.
# # it can push specific errors or all errors. 
# try: 
#     x = 10/0
# except ZeroDivisionError:
#     print("cannot divide by zero")

#     #this is a case of multiple exception.
#     try:
#         number = int("abc") #valueerror
#         result = 10/0 #zerodivisionerror.
#     except ValueError:
#         print("Invalid Conversion to integer.")
#     except ZeroDivisionError:
#         print("cannot divide by zero.")

# #the finally block.

# #always runs, whether an error occured or not.
# #useful for cleanup tasks(e.g. closing files, releasing resources.)
# try:
#     f = open("sample.txt", "r")
#     content = f.read()
# except FileNotFoundError:
#     print("File not found")
# finally:
#     print("closing file if it was opened.")

        print(f"Withdrawal Successful. New balance: N{balance:,.2f}")
