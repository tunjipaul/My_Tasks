# #while loop
# # a while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is true. 
# #code block.
# # - the condition must evaluate to True for the loop continue running.
# # - when the condition becomes false the loop stops.

# # let the loop start with count = 1
# # let it keep printing until count is greater than 5
# # let the loop terminate when the condition is no longer true.
# #my code.
# # count = 1
# # while count <= 5:
# #     print("Number:", count)
# #     count += 1
# #incrementing with 'while'
# # num = 1
# # while num <= 10:
# #     print(num, end = " ")
# #     num += 1
# #     #decrementing with 'while'
# #     timer = 10
# #     while timer > 0:
# #         print("Countdown:", timer)
# #         timer -=1
#     # while with user input
#     #     keep asking until the user enters a correct password.
# # password = ""
# # while password != "python123":
# #         password = input("Enter the password: ")
# # print("access granted")

# #understanding while True.
# #- the While True is an infinite loop - it keeps running forever until you explicitly stop it with a break statement or by exiting the program.
# # it is commonly used when:
# #- you  don't know in advance how mnay times you want the loop to run.
# # you want to keep asking the user for input until a valid condition is met.
# # you are building continuous programs like menus, login systems, or simulations.

# #while True:
# #code block
# #must include a break statement to stop


# #keep asking the user for a name until they type "exit."

# # while True:
# #     name =input("enter your name (type exit to quit): ")
# #     if name.lower() == "exit":
# #         print("goodbye!")
# #         break
# #     print(f"hello,{name}")
#     ##use-cases
#     #_ in chat-like applications, forms, or data entry programs where users may input multiple items until they decide to stop.


#     #loop control statements (break, continue and pass)
#     #these keywords help us control the behaviour of loops (for and while).
#     #instead of loops always running all iterations, we can skip steps, stop early or do ntohing intentionally.

#     #1. break.
#     #stops loop immediately. it is used if acondition is met and there's no need to continue looping.

# # for num in range (1,10):
# #         if num == 5:
# #             break
# #         print(num)

#         #the loop stops completely when num == 5.
#         #stop searching when an item is found.
#         #exit when user input matches a condition.
#         #prevent unnecessary iterations.

#         #2.continue
#         #skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
#         #it is used if you want to ignore some values but keep the loop running.

# for num in range(1,6):
#             if num == 3:
#                 continue
#             print(num)
#         #     #3 is skipped, but the loop continues.
#         #     ##some usecases
#         #     #skip invalid data.
#         #     #ignore unwanted characters (like spaces in a string)

#         #     #3. pass, it does nothing.a placeholder to avoid errors. it is used if you haven't written the code yet but want to keep the structure.
#         #     for num in range(1,6):
#         #         if num == 3:
